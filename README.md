# polish-bankruptcy-prediction
This repository contains code for a bankruptcy prediction algorithm developed for class 15.072, MIT Fall 2022. 

The algorithm takes in finnancial data from a given company and produces a binary prediction of whether the bank will file for bankruptcy in the future. The training data consist of Polish companies, making the final algorithm best suited for that domain. Our student team compared multiple approaches to this prediction problem and ultimately achieved 0.95 AUC and 0.72 recall using gradient boosting.

Contents:
* `Data` - finnancial data for Polish companies, used to train and test our classification models
* `EDA` - exploratory data analysis for the project
* `Models` - implementations for several bankruptcy classifiers
* `Results` - plots and figures of model performance
* `Project_Report.pdf` - contains the written report for this project, submitted as a final deliverable for class 15.072
* `Project_Slidedeck.pdf` - contains the presentation slidedeck for this project, presented as a final deliverable for class 15.072
