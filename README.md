# polish-bankruptcy-prediction
This repository contains code for a bankruptcy prediction algorithm developed for class 15.072, MIT Fall 2022. 

The algorithm takes in finnancial data from a given company and produces a binary prediction of whether the bank will file for bankruptcy in the future. The training data consist of Polish companies, making the final algorithm best suited for that domain. Our student team compared multiple approaches to this prediction problem and ultimately achieved 0.95 AUC and 0.72 recall using gradient boosting.
